<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Kanchan, a passionate and aspiring web developer on a mission to turn creative ideas into interactive digital experiences. What started as just a thought—a spark of curiosity about how websites work—has now transformed into a growing reality. Today, I'm actively building the skills and confidence to design and develop responsive, user-friendly, and engaging websites.

  <p>I believe in the power of the web to connect, inspire, and empower. Every line of code I write brings me one step closer to creating something meaningful. From basic layouts to dynamic, interactive platforms, I’m steadily moving toward my dream of crafting websites that don’t just work—but make people feel something.</p>
  
<p>This is just the beginning. I’m excited about the journey ahead and all the innovative projects I’ll bring to life.</p>
